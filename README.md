# MERN Stack Application

This repository contains the codebase for a web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.

## Overview

Provide a brief description of your application here. What does it do? What problem does it solve? What are its key features?

**Example:**

> This application is a simple task management tool that allows users to create, organize, and track their daily tasks. It leverages the power of the MERN stack to provide a responsive and efficient user experience.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * React
    * [Mention any specific UI libraries or frameworks used, e.g., Material UI, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap]
* **Backend:**
    * Node.js
    * Express.js
* **Database:**
    * MongoDB
    * Mongoose (for MongoDB object modeling)
* **Other:**
    * [Mention any other relevant technologies or libraries, e.g., Redux, Context API, Axios, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken]

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Node.js (version >= 14)
* npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn
* MongoDB (you'll need a running MongoDB server)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Rywkse/MERN_stack.git](https://github.com/Rywkse/MERN_stack.git)
    cd MERN_stack
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

### Configuration

1.  **Backend Configuration:**
    * Navigate to the `backend` directory.
    * Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file (if provided) or create the following environment variables:
        ```
        MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        PORT=your_preferred_backend_port (e.g., 5000)
        [Add any other necessary environment variables, e.g., JWT_SECRET]
        ```
        Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with the connection string to your MongoDB database.

2.  **Frontend Configuration:**
    * Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
    * Create a `.env` or `.env.local` file (depending on your React setup) and define any necessary environment variables, such as the backend API URL:
        ```
        REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:your_preferred_backend_port
        ```
        Make sure the port matches the one you set in the backend `.env` file.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run server  # or yarn run server
    ```

    This command will typically start your Node.js/Express server.

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm start  # or yarn start
    ```

    This command will usually start the React development server, and the application should be accessible in your browser at a specified address (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## Usage

Explain how to use your application. Provide examples of key features and how users can interact with them. Include screenshots or GIFs if helpful.

**Example:**

> Once the application is running, you can navigate through the following features:
>
> * **Task List:** View all your current tasks.
> * **Add New Task:** Click the "Add Task" button to create a new task, providing a title and description.
> * **Mark as Completed:** Check the checkbox next to a task to mark it as complete.
> * **Delete Task:** Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it.
